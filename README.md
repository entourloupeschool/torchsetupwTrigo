TorchSetup with Trigonometric Functions
Description

This project aims to explore hyperparameter tuning and model structuring using PyTorch and tensors. It includes a few Python programs that perform searches for the best hyperparameters and model structures using random data and trigonometric functions. This project serves as a training ground for those interested in learning about tensors and the PyTorch library.
